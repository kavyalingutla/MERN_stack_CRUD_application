**Candidate Management System - MERN Stack Application**

Introduction:
Developed a Candidate Management System to efficiently manage and track data for 1000 candidates who applied for various roles within a specific company. 
The system facilitates CRUD operations while providing detailed candidate information.

**Key Features:**
- Created a user-friendly front-end using React.js for intuitive candidate data display.
- Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manipulate candidate records.
- Leveraged Express.js and Node.js on the server-side for efficient application logic.
- Utilized MongoDB, a document database, to store comprehensive candidate details.
- Designed a RESTful API to enable seamless data interaction and manipulation.
- Utilized Postman for API testing and validation.

**MERN Stack Architecture:**
The application follows the MERN stack architecture, incorporating:
- MongoDB: Document database for data storage.
- Express.js: Web framework for application logic.
- React.js: Client-side JavaScript framework for dynamic UI.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- Postman: Testing tool for API development.

**Document Data Format: JSON**
JSON is a data format that represents the values of objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and nulls.
The Extended JSONformat definesareserved set of keys prefixed with "$" to represent field type information that directly 
corresponds to each type in BSON, the format that MongoDBusestostore data.

--This is how json document appears after importing to database.

MongoDB Atlas to MongoDB Compass Integration:
- Demonstrated proficiency in database management by connecting MongoDB Atlas to MongoDB Compass.
- Utilized a connection string obtained from MongoDB Atlas to establish a secure connection.
- Imported JSON documents directly into MongoDB Compass for seamless data access and management.

This experience showcases an understanding of database connectivity and data manipulation within a modern database environment.

Frontend Development:
- Employed React.js for the frontend, leveraging its capabilities to optimize code and enhance user experience.
- Utilized React's component-based architecture for efficient and modular UI development.

Backend Development:
- Leveraged Express.js and Node.js on the backend to establish connections between Postman API, MongoDB, and the client-server.
- Demonstrated proficiency in building server-side logic and API endpoints for data communication.

**POSTMAN API:**
Postman is a standalone software testing API (Application ProgrammingInterface) platform to build, test, design, modify, and document APIs.
 It isasimple Graphic User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requestsandresponses. While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write
any HTTP client network code. Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact with the API. this tool, nearly any functionality 
that any developer may need is embedded. This tool hastheability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, andconvert the API to code for many languages.
